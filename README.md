   Hi! My name is Mika Lin and I am currently a 12th grader at Burnaby South. My parents are Taiwanese but I was born in Canada and Iâ€™ve lived here for 15 years. 

   My hobbies include hanging out with friends, hiking, travelling, watching Netflix and eating. Some of my favourite foods are sushi, ramen, pho, and bubble tea. I also like to listen to music a lot. 

   My favourite subjects in school are Chemistry, Calculus and Biology. 

   I am currently working at a pharmacy as a Pharmacy Assistant.
