            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Mika Lin and I am currently a 12th grader at Burnaby South. My parents are Taiwanese but I was 
               born in Canada and Iâ€™ve lived here for 15 years. My hobbies include hanging out with friends, hiking, 
               travelling, watching Netflix and eating. Some of my favourite foods are sushi, ramen, pho, and bubble tea. I 
               also like to listen to music a lot. My favourite subjects in school are Chemistry, Calculus and Biology. I am 
               currently working at a pharmacy as a Pharmacy Assistant.</p>
